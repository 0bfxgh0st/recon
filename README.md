# Recon

Automated first-look recon script build for Hack The Box.

## How to use

You can either install it or run the script. If you just want to run the script like this:

```
./recon $ip_address
```

If you want to use it everywhere, just run it like this:

```
bash ./install.sh
# Or
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```

And after that you can run in the terminal the following command:
```
recon $ip_address
```
